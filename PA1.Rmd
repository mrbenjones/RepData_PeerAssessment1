## Loading and preprocessing the data

This step is completely straightforward.  I unzip the existing file in the archive (no need to check in the csv),
and read the frame, which already has column headers. 
```{r}
unzip("activity.zip")
activityData<-read.csv("activity.csv")
dim(activityData)
head(activityData,n=1)
library(plyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}
totals<-ddply(activityData,.(date),summarise,steps=sum(steps,na.rm=F))
meanSteps<-mean(totals$steps,na.rm=T)
meanSteps
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r}
intervalTotals<-ddply(activityData,.(date),steps=mean(steps,na.rm=F))
q<-ggplot(data=intervalTotals,aes(x=interval,y=steps))+geom_line()
q
```


## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
